# Java-Structures
A bunch of data structures and their operations designed in Java for educational purposes.

# Linked Lists
- Dynamically sizing
- No random access
- Nodes point to other nodes

### Operations:
##### Insert
	- insertHead
		- Inserts a new head node
	- insertEnd
		- Inserts a node to the end
	- insertAt
		- Inserts a node at an index (starting at 0=head)
##### Delete
	- deleteHead
		- Deletes the head node
	- deleteEnd
		- Deletes the last node
	- deleteAt
		- Deletes a node at an index (starting at 0=head)
##### Other
	- print
		- Prints easily readable list
	- printReverse
		- Prints the list in reverse (Doubly Linked List Only)
	- search
		- Searches the list for a key
	- getSize
		- Returns how many nodes are in the list

### Singly Linked List
- Nodes point to only the next node

### Doubly Linked List
- Nodes point to the previous and next node

### Cirular Linked List
- Last node points back to the head node
